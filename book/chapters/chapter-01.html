        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to your journey of building a GPU from scratch! Whether you're a final-year computer science student, 
            an aspiring GPU engineer, or launching a hardware startup, this book will take you from the very basics to 
            sending a chip design to a manufacturer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's start with a simple question: <strong>What is a GPU, really?</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>1.1 The Classroom Analogy</h2>
        
        <p>
            Imagine you have a huge worksheet with 1,000 simple math problems. You have two choices:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Option A:</strong> Give it to one super-smart student who solves problems very quickly, one after another.</li>
            <li><strong>Option B:</strong> Give it to a classroom of 1,000 students, where each student solves just one problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Option A is like a <strong>CPU</strong> (Central Processing Unit). It's incredibly smart and fast at solving 
            complex problems, but it can only work on one thing at a time (or a few things with modern multi-core CPUs).
        </p>

        <p>
            Option B is like a <strong>GPU</strong> (Graphics Processing Unit). It might not be as clever for complex problems, 
            but when you have lots of similar, simple work to do, it crushes through it in parallel.
        </p>

        <div class="key-takeaway">
            <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> GPUs are designed for <em>throughput</em> (doing lots of work in parallel), 
            while CPUs are designed for <em>latency</em> (doing one thing as fast as possible).
        </div>

        <h2>1.2 Where Did GPUs Come From?</h2>

        <h3>The Graphics Era (1990s - 2000s)</h3>
        <p>
            GPUs were originally built to draw pixels on your screen for video games. When you play a game, the computer 
            needs to:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take 3D shapes (triangles)</li>
            <li>Figure out where they appear on your 2D screen</li>
            <li>Color every single pixel</li>
            <li>Do this 60+ times per second</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            For a 1920×1080 screen, that's over 2 million pixels! And each pixel might need complex calculations for 
            lighting, shadows, reflections, and textures. A CPU would take forever. But since the same operation 
            (like "calculate this pixel's color") happens millions of times, it's perfect for parallel processing.
        </p>

        <h3>The GPGPU Revolution (2006 onwards)</h3>
        <p>
            Around 2006, NVIDIA released CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), which let programmers use GPUs 
            for <em>any</em> parallel computation, not just graphics. This was called <strong>GPGPU</strong> 
            (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units).
        </p>

        <p>
            Suddenly, GPUs became incredibly useful for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scientific computing:</strong> weather simulation, protein folding, physics</li>
            <li><strong>Finance:</strong> risk analysis, options pricing</li>
            <li><strong>Image/video processing:</strong> encoding, filtering, computer vision</li>
            <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Bitcoin mining</li>
            <li><strong>AI/Machine Learning:</strong> training neural networks (the biggest use today)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>1.3 Real-World Applications Today</h2>

        <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>
            Training a large language model like GPT or Llama requires processing billions of numbers in parallel. 
            Modern AI training clusters use thousands of GPUs working together. A single training run can cost millions 
            of dollars in GPU time.
        </p>

        <h3>Graphics & Gaming</h3>
        <p>
            Modern games use <strong>ray tracing</strong> to simulate realistic light bounces. This requires tracing 
            millions of light rays per frame. GPUs now include specialized "ray tracing cores" just for this.
        </p>

        <h3>Scientific Research</h3>
        <p>
            Protein folding simulations (like AlphaFold) use GPUs to explore billions of molecular configurations. 
            Weather models run on GPU clusters to predict storms days in advance.
        </p>

        <h3>Cryptocurrency</h3>
        <p>
            Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum (before "The Merge") rely on GPUs to perform 
            trillions of hash operations per second.
        </p>

        <h2>1.4 Why Build Your Own GPU?</h2>

        <p>
            You might be thinking: "NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel already make amazing GPUs. Why build my own?"
        </p>

        <p>Here are some great reasons:</p>

        <h3>1. Learning</h3>
        <p>
            Building a GPU teaches you about computer architecture, parallel programming, hardware design, and 
            the entire chip development flow. These skills are valuable across the tech industry.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Custom Accelerators</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes you need a specialized chip for a specific task. Companies build custom GPUs for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Edge AI inference (Google's Edge TPU, Tesla's FSD chip)</li>
            <li>Video encoding/decoding</li>
            <li>Networking and packet processing</li>
            <li>Cryptocurrency mining ASICs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Startup Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
            There's a growing market for domain-specific accelerators. If you can build a chip that's 10× better 
            for a specific workload, you might have a business. Examples: Groq (AI inference), Tenstorrent, Cerebras.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Open-Source Hardware</h3>
        <p>
            The open-source hardware movement is growing. Projects like RISC-V show that open ISAs can compete with 
            proprietary ones. We need open GPU designs too!
        </p>

        <div class="key-takeaway">
            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> You don't need to beat NVIDIA at gaming GPUs. Find a niche where 
            specialization matters more than raw performance.
        </div>

                <strong>💡 Learning Tip:</strong> Start with the GitHub repos for "CUDA by Example" and "PMPP" — 
                they contain all the hands-on code examples you can compile and run immediately. The NVIDIA CUDA 
                Programming Guide is your authoritative reference for detailed API behavior. Use the paper for 
                historical context on GPU evolution.
